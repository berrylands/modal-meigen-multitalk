# Wan 2.2 Integration Analysis Summary

## Executive Summary

After thorough analysis, **Wan 2.2 is NOT directly compatible** with MultiTalk without significant architectural changes. The models use fundamentally different architectures.

## Key Findings

### 1. Architecture Mismatch
- **Wan 2.1**: Uses standard Diffusers `UNet3DConditionModel` architecture
- **Wan 2.2**: Uses custom `WanModel` architecture (transformer-based)
  - 40 layers transformer
  - 5120 dimensions
  - 40 attention heads
  - Completely different from UNet3D

### 2. Model Structure
- **Wan 2.2 Structure**:
  ```
  - high_noise_model/ (WanModel architecture)
  - low_noise_model/ (WanModel architecture)
  - Wan2.1_VAE.pth (shared VAE)
  - google/umt5-xxl/ (text encoder)
  ```

### 3. Compatibility Issues
1. **Architecture**: WanModel vs UNet3DConditionModel - completely incompatible
2. **Loading**: MultiTalk expects Diffusers pipeline, Wan 2.2 uses custom loader
3. **Weights**: Different tensor shapes and layer structures
4. **MoE**: Two expert models vs single model expected

## Integration Feasibility

### ❌ Not Feasible: Direct Integration
- Cannot use Wan 2.2 as drop-in replacement
- Model architectures are fundamentally incompatible
- Would require complete rewrite of MultiTalk

### ⚠️ Possible but Complex: Full Rewrite
- Rewrite MultiTalk to support WanModel architecture
- Implement MoE support
- Significant engineering effort (weeks to months)
- Risk of breaking existing functionality

## Recommendation

**STOP the Wan 2.2 integration effort**. The architectural differences are too significant for practical integration. Instead:

1. **Continue using Wan 2.1** - It's already working well with MultiTalk
2. **Monitor MultiTalk updates** - Check if official support for Wan 2.2 is added
3. **Consider alternatives**:
   - Wait for Wan models that maintain UNet3D compatibility
   - Explore other video generation models with similar architecture to Wan 2.1

## Technical Details

### Wan 2.2 Config Sample
```json
{
  "_class_name": "WanModel",
  "dim": 5120,
  "num_layers": 40,
  "num_heads": 40,
  "model_type": "i2v"
}
```

### Expected by MultiTalk
```json
{
  "_class_name": "UNet3DConditionModel",
  "in_channels": 10,
  "out_channels": 8,
  "block_out_channels": [320, 640, 1280, 1280]
}
```

## Conclusion

The upgrade from Wan 2.1 to Wan 2.2 is **not feasible** without a complete architectural overhaul of MultiTalk. The benefits of Wan 2.2 (MoE, better quality) do not justify the massive engineering effort required for integration.
