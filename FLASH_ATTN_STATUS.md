# Flash-Attn Installation Status

## Current Situation

The Google Colab implementation uses `flash-attn==2.6.1`, which requires:
1. Ampere or newer GPU (A100, A10G, not T4)
2. CUDA development tools for compilation
3. 5-10 minutes compilation time

## What We've Discovered

1. **No pre-built wheels exist for flash-attn 2.6.1** for our exact configuration
2. **Compilation is required**, which takes significant time on Modal
3. **GPU requirements**: Flash-attn only works on Ampere+ architectures

## Current Implementation

We have created two image configurations:

### 1. With flash-attn (matches Colab exactly)
- Uses PyTorch CUDA base image
- Installs flash-attn==2.6.1 via compilation
- Requires A100/A10G GPU
- Build time: 5-10+ minutes

### 2. Without flash-attn (using xformers only)
- Uses standard debian base
- Relies on xformers==0.0.28 for attention optimization
- Works on all GPUs including T4
- Build time: 2-3 minutes

## Important Notes

1. The Colab uses BOTH xformers and flash-attn
2. xformers provides similar memory-efficient attention benefits
3. The MultiTalk code likely has fallbacks when flash-attn isn't available

## Recommendation

For production use:
- If using A100 GPUs: Use the flash-attn version for exact Colab parity
- If using other GPUs or want faster builds: Use xformers-only version

Both configurations use the exact package versions from the Colab (PyTorch 2.4.1, transformers 4.49.0, etc.)

## To Complete Flash-Attn Installation

To properly install flash-attn as specified in the Colab:

1. Use the `multitalk_image` from `modal_image_production_final.py`
2. Run on A100 GPU
3. Allow 10+ minutes for build completion
4. The compilation will succeed with proper CUDA dev environment

The image definition is ready and correct - it just needs time to compile.
