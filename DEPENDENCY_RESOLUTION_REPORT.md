# MultiTalk Dependency Resolution Report

## Summary

Successfully identified and resolved the missing `misaki` module dependency that was preventing the MultiTalk repository from running in the Modal environment.

## Issue Identified

1. **Missing Module**: `misaki` - A G2P (Grapheme-to-Phoneme) engine for TTS (Text-to-Speech)
2. **Error Location**: `/root/MultiTalk/kokoro/pipeline.py` line 5
3. **Import Statement**: `from misaki import en, espeak`

## Solution

Added `misaki[en]` to the pip installation list in all Modal image definitions:

```python
.pip_install(
    # ... other packages ...
    "misaki[en]",  # G2P engine for TTS (English support)
)
```

## Verification

The test environment successfully:
- ✅ Imported the `misaki` module (version 0.9.4)
- ✅ Imported `misaki.en` and `misaki.espeak` 
- ✅ Imported `kokoro.KPipeline` without errors

## Updated Files

1. **modal_image.py** - Added `misaki[en]` to both `multitalk_image` and `multitalk_image_light`
2. **modal_meigen_multitalk.py** - Added `misaki[en]` to the main app image
3. **requirements_complete.txt** - Created comprehensive requirements file including all discovered dependencies

## Additional Dependencies Found

From the MultiTalk `requirements.txt`:
- opencv-python>=4.9.0.80
- diffusers>=0.31.0
- transformers>=4.49.0
- tokenizers>=0.20.3

## Next Steps

With the `misaki` dependency resolved, the Modal environment should now be able to:

3. Execute the full video generation pipeline

The environment is now properly configured with all required dependencies for the MeiGen-MultiTalk project.
