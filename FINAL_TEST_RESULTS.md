## Important Notes

1. **HuggingFace Token**: The token is stored as `HF_TOKEN` (not `HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN`) in Modal secrets. Our code handles both names for compatibility.

2. **Authentication Method**: HuggingFace authentication works via the `huggingface-hub` library, not direct Bearer token API calls.

3. **Ready for Production**: The environment is now ready to:
   - Download models from HuggingFace
   - Store/retrieve files from S3
   - Deploy ML models on Modal

## Verification Command
```bash
modal run test_complete_setup.py::verify_complete_setup

## Issue #1 Status
