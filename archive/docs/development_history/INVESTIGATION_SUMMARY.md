# MultiTalk Investigation Summary

## What We've Discovered

### 1. The Colab Works Differently
- **No --frame_num parameter** in Colab command (we were adding it)
- Colab lets the model determine frame count from audio
- Default is likely 81 frames (~3.4 seconds)

### 2. Audio Processing Requirements
- **MUST resample to 16kHz** for wav2vec2 model
- Audio duration determines video length when no frame_num specified
- Your 1.wav is 1.79 seconds (short for default expectations)

### 3. Frame Count Constraints  
- When using --frame_num, must follow 4n+1 pattern (21, 45, 81, etc.)
- Without --frame_num, model determines automatically
- Shape errors occur with invalid frame counts

### 4. Current Issues

#### Shape Mismatch Error
```
RuntimeError: shape '[1, 11, 4, 56, 112]' is invalid for input of size 288512
```

This persists even when:
- Using valid frame counts (45, 81)
- Following exact Colab command (no frame_num)
- Audio properly preprocessed to 16kHz

#### Possible Causes
1. **Image resolution mismatch** - MultiTalk might expect specific dimensions
2. **Model configuration** - Something about the model setup differs from Colab
3. **Missing preprocessing** - Colab might do additional image/audio processing
4. **Version differences** - Despite matching package versions

## What's Working

✅ S3 integration - perfect
✅ Model downloads - all 3 models present
✅ Audio resampling - 16kHz working
✅ Infrastructure - Modal, GPU, dependencies
✅ Model setup - weights copied correctly

## What's Not Working

❌ Final inference - shape mismatch in model
❌ Can't get past tensor reshape operation

## Key Differences from Colab

1. **Colab has working test files** - We're using your S3 files
2. **Colab environment** - Might have additional setup we're missing
3. **Input specifications** - Image resolution/format might matter

## Recommendations

1. **Test with Colab's exact test files** if available
2. **Check image dimensions** - Try resizing to standard resolutions
3. **Debug tensor shapes** - Add logging to MultiTalk code
4. **Compare with working Colab run** - Get exact inputs/outputs

## Conclusion

We've successfully:
- Built complete infrastructure
- Implemented proper audio processing
- Set up models correctly
- Created multiple implementation approaches

The final blocker appears to be a model architecture expectation that we haven't identified. Since the Colab works, the issue is likely:
- Specific input requirements (image size?)
- Environmental differences
- Missing configuration

The shape error is consistent and specific, suggesting a systematic issue rather than random failure.
