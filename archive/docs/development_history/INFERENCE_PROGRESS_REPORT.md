# MultiTalk Inference Progress Report

## ✅ Successfully Completed

1. **S3 Integration** - Fully working
   - Downloads multi1.png and 1.wav from S3 bucket `760572149-framepack`
   - Uploads generated outputs back to S3
   - Tested and confirmed working

2. **Modal Environment Setup** - Image builds successfully
   - PyTorch 2.4.1 with CUDA 12.1
   - xformers 0.0.28
   - All required dependencies installed
   - MultiTalk repository cloned

3. **GPU Access** - Confirmed working
   - A10G, T4, and A100 access available
   - Proper GPU detection and memory reporting

## 🔧 Issues Encountered

### 1. NumPy Version Conflict
- **Error**: `ImportError: Numba needs NumPy 1.26 or less`
- **Solution**: Changed from numpy==1.26.4 to numpy==1.24.4
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

### 2. Missing misaki Package
- **Error**: Import error for misaki G2P engine
- **Solution**: Added "misaki[en]" to pip_install
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

### 3. Audio Length Mismatch
- **Error**: `AssertionError: Audio file not exists or length not satisfies frame nums.`
- **Analysis**: Audio duration doesn't match expected frame count (81 frames @ 24fps = ~3.4s)
- **Status**: ⚠️ Identified but not fully resolved

### 4. Model Shape Mismatch
- **Error**: `RuntimeError: shape '[1, 11, 4, 56, 112]' is invalid for input of size 288512`
- **Analysis**: Occurs when using adaptive frame counts
- **Cause**: MultiTalk architecture expects specific frame dimensions
- **Status**: ⚠️ Requires using standard frame counts

### 5. Models Not Pre-downloaded
- **Error**: Script won't run even with --help
- **Analysis**: MultiTalk requires models to be available before execution
- **Status**: 🚧 Currently working on this

## 🎯 Current Focus

**Need to ensure models are downloaded and properly set up before inference:**

1. Download and set up these models:
   - `Wan-AI/Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P` (base model)
   - `TencentGameMate/chinese-wav2vec2-base` (audio encoder)
   - `MeiGen-AI/MeiGen-MultiTalk` (MultiTalk weights)

2. Critical setup steps from Colab:
   ```bash
   # Copy MultiTalk weights into base model
   mv base/diffusion_pytorch_model.safetensors.index.json base/old_index.json
   cp multitalk/diffusion_pytorch_model.safetensors.index.json base/
   cp multitalk/multitalk.safetensors base/
   ```

3. Use correct VRAM parameters:
   - A10G: ~8GB → 8000000000
   - A100-40GB: ~11GB → 11000000000

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Create model download function** that runs before inference
2. **Test with standard 81 frames** (don't try to adapt frame count)
3. **Ensure audio preprocessing** matches MultiTalk expectations
4. **Use exact Colab command structure** for inference

## 🔍 Key Learnings

- MultiTalk has very specific requirements for model setup
- Frame count must match architecture constraints
- Audio duration should match video duration expectations
- Models must be pre-downloaded and properly configured
- S3 integration works perfectly - ready for real inference

## 📊 Current Status

- **Infrastructure**: ✅ Complete (Modal + S3)
- **Dependencies**: ✅ Complete (all packages working)
- **Model Setup**: 🚧 In Progress
- **Inference**: ⏳ Pending model setup
- **End-to-End Test**: ⏳ Pending inference success
