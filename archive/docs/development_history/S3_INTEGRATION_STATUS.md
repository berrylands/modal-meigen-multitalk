# S3 Integration Status

## ‚úÖ Successfully Completed

### S3 Access Verified
- Bucket: `760572149-framepack` (from AWS_BUCKET_NAME Modal secret)
- Files confirmed:
  - `multi1.png` - Input image
  - `1.wav` - Input audio

### Working S3 Applications Created

1. **test_s3_with_secret.py** - Basic S3 access test
   - ‚úÖ Verified bucket access
   - ‚úÖ Downloaded multi1.png successfully
   - ‚úÖ Uploaded test file successfully

2. **test_s3_generation.py** - S3 + GPU test
   - ‚úÖ Downloaded inputs from S3
   - ‚úÖ GPU (T4) available and working
   - ‚úÖ Uploaded output to S3
   - Output: `s3://760572149-framepack/test_outputs/test_output_20250725_104202.mp4`

3. **app_s3_simple.py** - Production-ready S3 app
   - ‚úÖ Downloads multi1.png and 1.wav from S3
   - ‚úÖ Creates placeholder output (actual inference not implemented)
   - ‚úÖ Uploads result to S3
   - Output: `s3://760572149-framepack/outputs/multitalk_20250725_104723.mp4`

### S3 Utilities Created

**s3_utils.py** - Reusable S3 manager class:
- `S3Manager` class with methods:
  - `download_file()` - Download individual files
  - `upload_file()` - Upload files to S3
  - `download_inputs()` - Download image + audio
  - `upload_output()` - Upload generated videos
  - `list_bucket_contents()` - List bucket files

## üìã Usage

### Running S3-enabled generation:
```bash
python app_s3_simple.py
```

This will:
1. Use AWS_BUCKET_NAME from Modal secrets
2. Download multi1.png and 1.wav from S3
3. Process them (placeholder for now)
4. Upload result to S3 under outputs/

### Checking S3 access:
```bash
python test_s3_with_secret.py
```

## üöß Next Steps

1. **Implement actual MultiTalk inference**
   - Replace placeholder with real video generation
   - Integrate with MultiTalk model code

2. **Test with full Modal image**
   - Once modal_image.py builds successfully
   - Include all ML dependencies

3. **Add more S3 features**
   - Batch processing
   - Progress tracking
   - Error handling for large files

## üìù Notes

- S3 integration is fully functional and tested
- Using Modal secrets for AWS credentials
- Files are downloaded to temp directories and cleaned up
- GPU access confirmed working (T4 tested)
- Ready for integration with actual inference code
