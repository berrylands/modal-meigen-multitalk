# Progress Report: Modal MeiGen-MultiTalk - Issue #2

## Current Status

Working on GitHub Issue #2: "Create custom Docker image with ML dependencies"

### Completed Tasks

1. ✅ Created Modal image definitions based on Colab notebook insights
2. ✅ Updated dependency versions to match working Colab configuration:
   - PyTorch 2.4.1 with CUDA 12.1
   - transformers 4.49.0 (pre-CVE version)
   - xformers 0.0.28 as alternative to flash-attn
3. ✅ Identified flash-attn build issues:
   - flash-attn 2.6.1 requires git during pip install
   - Build fails because git submodule update is called before git is available
4. ✅ Created multiple image configurations:
   - `modal_image.py` - Original with flash-attn (build fails)
   - `modal_image_working.py` - Without flash-attn, using xformers
   - `modal_image_simplified.py` - Minimal working configuration
5. ✅ Verified basic Modal functionality works with simple images

### Current Issues

1. **Image Build Failures**: Complex images with many dependencies fail to build
   - Error: "Image build for im-XXX failed"
   - Modal's build logs are not visible in terminal despite `modal.enable_output()`
   - Need to check Modal dashboard for detailed build logs

2. **flash-attn Installation**: 
   - Requires git available during pip install phase
   - Even with git in apt_install, the build order causes issues
   - Workaround: Use xformers for attention optimization instead

3. **Build Timeouts**: Image builds are taking very long (>2 minutes)

### What Works

- ✅ Basic PyTorch installation with CUDA support
- ✅ Simple package installations (numpy, transformers, etc.)
- ✅ GPU detection and basic tensor operations
- ✅ Modal authentication and secrets (AWS, HuggingFace)

### Next Steps

1. Check Modal dashboard for detailed build logs
2. Consider breaking down the image into smaller, composable layers
3. Potentially use Modal's layer caching more effectively
4. Once image builds successfully:
   - Implement model download functionality (Issue #3)
   - Create inference wrapper (Issue #4)

### Recommendations

1. **For immediate progress**: Use the simplified image and add packages incrementally
2. **For production**: Investigate Modal's build logs on dashboard to diagnose the exact failure
3. **Alternative approach**: Consider using Modal's pre-built ML images as base and adding only MeiGen-specific dependencies

## Technical Details

### Working Configuration (Simplified)
```python
modal.Image.debian_slim(python_version="3.10")
    .apt_install(["git", "ffmpeg", "build-essential"])
    .pip_install("torch==2.4.1", index_url="https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121")
    .pip_install("transformers==4.49.0")
    .pip_install("huggingface_hub")
```

### Problematic Packages
- flash-attn==2.6.1 (git submodule issue)
- Large combined pip installs (unknown specific failure)

### Environment Verification
- Created comprehensive test scripts to verify environment
- GPU support confirmed working with Tesla T4
- HuggingFace and AWS secrets properly configured
