# Modal Setup Testing Summary

## ✅ Completed Setup Steps

### 1. Modal Authentication
- Modal API token configured in `.env`
- Authentication successful using `MODAL_AUTH_TOKEN`
- Modal CLI version: 1.1.0

### 2. AWS Secret Configuration
- AWS secret created in Modal dashboard
- Successfully tested S3 access
- Region set to `eu-west-1`
- Can list S3 buckets (found 310 buckets)

### 3. Successful Tests
- ✅ Modal CLI working (`modal --version`)
- ✅ Can list Modal apps (`modal app list`)
- ✅ AWS credentials accessible in Modal functions
- ✅ S3 client creation and bucket listing working
- ✅ Main app building with dependencies

### 4. Test Scripts Created
- `test_simple.py` - Basic connectivity test
- `test_aws_simple.py` - AWS secret verification
- `test_secrets.py` - Secret access testing
- `verify_setup.py` - Setup verification
- `test_all.sh` - Comprehensive test suite

## Current Status

The Modal environment is fully configured and working:

1. **Authentication**: API token authentication successful
2. **Secrets**: AWS secret configured and accessible
3. **Connectivity**: Can deploy and run Modal functions
4. **S3 Integration**: AWS S3 access verified

## Pending Items

1. **HuggingFace Secret**: Created but token appears invalid (401 error)
   - Token exists as `HF_TOKEN` in Modal secrets
   - May need to be regenerated or checked for validity
2. **Full Deployment**: Main app not yet deployed (building dependencies)

## Test Results

### AWS Secret Test (Working)
```bash
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID exists: True
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY exists: True
AWS_REGION: eu-west-1
Key prefix: AKIA...
✅ S3 Access successful! Found 310 buckets
```

### HuggingFace Secret Test (Needs Attention)
```bash
✅ Token found as: HF_TOKEN
Token length: 37 characters
Token prefix: hf_LSiBI...
❌ HF API Access: Failed with status 401
Response: {"error":"Invalid credentials in Authorization header"}
```

Note: The HuggingFace token exists but appears to be invalid or expired. This won't block basic Modal functionality but will be needed for model downloads.

## Next Steps

1. Create PR for Issue #1
2. Move to Issue #2 (Docker image with ML dependencies)
3. Add HuggingFace secret when needed for model downloads
