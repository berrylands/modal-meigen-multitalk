# Actual Testing Status - Issue #2

## VERIFIED WORKING on Modal:

### Layer-by-Layer Testing (test_image_layers.py)
✅ Layer 1: PyTorch 2.4.1 + xformers 0.0.28 - TESTED on T4 GPU
✅ Layer 2: + Core ML packages (peft, accelerate, einops, omegaconf) - TESTED
✅ Layer 3: + Audio packages (librosa, soundfile, scipy) - TESTED  
✅ Layer 4: + Video packages (opencv-python, moviepy, imageio) - TESTED
✅ Layer 5: + Diffusers and utilities - TESTED

### Environment Testing (test_fixed_image.py)
✅ Basic image with core packages - TESTED and WORKING
✅ GPU compute verified on Tesla T4
✅ Secrets (AWS, HuggingFace) accessible
✅ MultiTalk repo successfully cloned

## NOT WORKING / NOT TESTED:

### flash-attn 2.6.1
❌ All build attempts timed out or failed
❌ Never successfully installed on Modal
❌ No verification it works even if it builds

### Complete "Production" Image
❌ Full image with all packages together - NOT TESTED
❌ No end-to-end validation
❌ No inference testing with actual MultiTalk code

## Current HONEST Status:

1. **We have a PARTIALLY tested configuration** that includes most packages
2. **flash-attn 2.6.1 is NOT working** - only theoretical solutions provided
3. **No complete image has been fully tested** end-to-end
4. **No actual MultiTalk inference has been attempted**

## What "Production-Ready" Would Actually Mean:

1. Complete image builds successfully (< 10 minutes)
2. All packages import without errors
3. GPU memory allocation works
4. Can load actual MultiTalk models
5. Can run inference on test data
6. Produces expected output
7. Handles errors gracefully
8. Performance is acceptable

**WE HAVE ACHIEVED NONE OF THE ABOVE for the complete system.**

## Next Steps for REAL Completion:

1. Pick either WITH or WITHOUT flash-attn and get it fully working
2. Build and test the complete image end-to-end
3. Run actual MultiTalk inference as proof
4. Only then can we consider Issue #2 complete
