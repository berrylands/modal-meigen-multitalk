# GitHub Issue #2 - REAL Status

## Issue: "Create custom Docker image with ML dependencies"

## ACTUAL Status: INCOMPLETE ❌

### What Actually Works:
- Individual package groups tested in isolation (Layers 1-5)
- Basic PyTorch + CUDA verified on GPU

### What Doesn't Work:
- Complete image build times out (>10 minutes)
- flash-attn 2.6.1 never successfully installed
- No end-to-end verification completed
- No inference testing done

### Core Problems:

1. **Build Timeouts**: Modal image builds with all packages timeout consistently
2. **flash-attn**: Requires compilation that takes too long for Modal's build process
3. **No Working Image**: We don't have a single fully-tested complete image

### What We Actually Have:

1. **Theory**: Image definitions that should work
2. **Partial Tests**: Individual components tested separately  
3. **No Production Image**: Nothing that's been proven to work end-to-end

### To ACTUALLY Complete Issue #2:

1. Get ONE complete image to build successfully
2. Verify ALL packages load correctly
3. Run actual MultiTalk inference as proof
4. Document the working configuration

## Recommendation:

We should either:
1. Increase build timeout limits (if possible)
2. Pre-build images differently
3. Use Modal's base ML images and add only what's needed
4. Accept that flash-attn won't work and document it

**Current state: Issue #2 is NOT complete by any reasonable definition.**
